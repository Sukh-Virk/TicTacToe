Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🤖
Think you can beat me? Think again.
Tic-Tac-Toe might seem like a simple game, but this AI isn’t here to play fair—it’s here to dominate. Armed with Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), this AI doesn’t just make moves; it calculates, predicts, and outsmarts. Every decision is backed by deep search strategies, ensuring it never loses. If you think you’ve got what it takes to defeat it, you might want to rethink your strategy.

🧠 The Intelligence Behind the AI
This AI isn't just throwing random Xs and Os on the board. It’s powered by three advanced algorithms:

Minimax Algorithm: It simulates every possible future move, evaluating outcomes to ensure the best decision is always made.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: A smarter version of Minimax that cuts off unnecessary calculations, making decisions faster without sacrificing accuracy.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Instead of brute force calculations, MCTS uses probability and simulations to explore the best possible moves dynamically.
Together, these techniques make this AI unbeatable. If you play perfectly, you might force a draw—but don’t expect any easy wins.

🚀 How to Play
Running the AI is simple. Just clone the repository and launch the game:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Sukh-Virk/TicTacToe.git
cd TicTacToe
python main.py
The game will start, and you can test your skills against the AI. You can also tweak main.py to watch an AI vs AI showdown, where pure logic battles itself.

⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3+ installed. If Monte Carlo simulations require NumPy

an improve the AI (or just want to try breaking it), feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. But fair warning—this AI isn’t going down without a fight.

💀 Good Luck… You’ll Need It.
